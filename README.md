# jupyter-notebook-singlestoredb

This is a simple repo for people to learn how to connect a notebook to SingleStoreDB, write dataframes into a SingleStoreDB database and read from a table. I am using gapminder dataset available in this repo. Feel free to download the notebook. that contains all the steps.
