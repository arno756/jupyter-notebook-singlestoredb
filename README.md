# Connecting a Jupyter notebook to SingleStoreDB and analyzing data

This is a simple repo for people to learn how to:
* connect a notebook to SingleStoreDB
* write dataframes into a SingleStoreDB database
* read from a SingleStoreDB table

The notebook I uploaded use the gapminder dataset, also available in this repo.

Let me know if you experience any issue.
